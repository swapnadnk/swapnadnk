# 👋 Hi, I’m Swapna Dirisala

I'm a Front-End and Automation Engineer with 7+ years of experience building internal tools, creative plugins, and scalable web apps.  
Lately, I've been focused on automating plugin lifecycle management and developing SwiftUI/macOS tools to support creative teams—especially within Apple’s production environment via Hogarth Worldwide.

My work spans from React UIs and Angular dashboards to unit testing with Jest and UI development for creative tools. I care about clean code, thoughtful UX, and building tools that make other people’s jobs easier.
