# 👋 Hi, I’m Swapna Dirisala

I'm a Front-End and Automation Engineer with 7+ years of experience building internal tools, creative plugins, and scalable web apps. Lately, I've been focused on automating plugin lifecycle management and developing SwiftUI/macOS tools to support creative teams—especially within Apple’s production environment via Hogarth Worldwide.

My work spans from React UIs and Angular dashboards to test automation with Cypress and Jest. I care about clean code, thoughtful UX, and building tools that make other people’s jobs easier.
